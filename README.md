## Multi-Task Spatiotemporal Neural Networks for Structured Surface Reconstruction

Created by Mingze Xu at Indiana University, Bloomington, IN

***Note:*** The released code and pretrained models are reimplemented on the following larger dataset.

### Environment

The code is developed with CUDA 8.0, ***Python 2.7***, ***PyTorch >= 0.4***

### Data Preparation

1. Download the raw data at `ftp://data.cresis.ku.edu/data/rds/2014_Greenland_P3/CSARP_music3D/`

2. Download the human-labled annotations at [`target.tar.gz`](./data/target.tar.gz)

- If you don't want to preprocess the data yourself, please use [`create_slices.m`](./scripts/create_slices_64x64/create_slices.m) to generate radar images and [`convert_mat_to_npy.py`](./scripts/convert_mat_to_npy.py) to convert them from MATLAB to NumPy files.

3. Make sure to put the files as the following structure:
  ```
  data_root
  ├── slices_mat_64x64
  |   ├── 20140325_05
  │   ├── 20140325_06
  |   ├── 20140325_07

  ```

### Pretrained Models

Download the pretrained model at [`pretrained_models`](./pretrained_models)

### Demo
To run the demo:
```
python demo.py --data_root {path/to/data_root} --c3d_pth {path/to/c3d.pth} --rnn_pth {path/to/rnn.pth}
```
